Description: Functions and scripts for computing the generalized independent
    variable hull (gIVH) and performing hierarchical analysis of count data.
    Scripts and functions are available for conducting simulation analysis and
    analyzing ribbon seal data in the Bering Sea, as reported in the article
    "On extrapolating past the range of observed data when making statistical
    predictions in ecology" by Conn et al.
